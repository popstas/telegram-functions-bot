## Config

Empty `config.yml` should be generated. Fill it with your data:
- agent_name (optional, autogenerated from bot_name or chat name)
- bot_name (deprecated)
- auth.token
- auth.chatgpt_api_key
- stt.whisperBaseUrl

### Multiple Bots / Secondary bot_token

You can run multiple Telegram bots from a single instance using the `bot_token` field in each chat config.

#### Use cases

- Run several bots with different tokens from the same codebase (e.g., main bot and test bot, or bots for different groups).
- Per-chat bot tokens: assign a unique bot token to a specific chat, while others use the global token.

#### How it works

- The bot will launch an instance for every unique `bot_token` found in `config.chats` and for the global `auth.bot_token`.
- If a chat does not specify its own `bot_token`, it will use the global `auth.bot_token`.
- Only one instance per unique token is launched (deduplicated automatically).

#### Example config

```yaml
auth:
  bot_token: "123456:main-token"
  chatgpt_api_key: "sk-..."
chats:
  - name: "Main Chat"
    id: 123456789
    # uses global auth.bot_token
  - name: "Secondary Bot Chat"
    id: 987654321
    bot_token: "987654:secondary-token"
    agent_name: "secondary_bot"
```

#### Notes

- If you launch two bots with the same token, Telegram will throw a 409 Conflict error. The bot automatically avoids this by deduplication.
- You must set `agent_name` (autogenerated if missing). `bot_name` is deprecated.
- You can set `privateUsers` in a chat config for extended access control.

## Use agents as tools

You can use one bot as a tool (agent) inside another bot. This allows you to compose complex workflows, delegate tasks, or chain multiple bots together.

### How it works

- In your chat config, add a tool entry with `agent_name`, `name`, and `description`.
- The main bot will expose this agent as a tool function. When called, it will internally send the request to the specified bot, as if a user messaged it.
- The agent bot processes the request and returns the result to the main bot, which includes it in the final answer.

### Example config

```yaml
chats:
  - name: Main Bot
    id: 10001
    tools:
      - agent_name: tool_bot
        name: add_task
        description: "Adds a task to the task list."
  - name: Bot as tool
    id: 10002
    agent_name: tool_bot
    bot_token: "987654:tool-token"
    systemMessage: "You accept a task text and return a structured task."
```

### Example usage

- The main bot exposes the `add_task` tool.
- When the tool is called (e.g., by function-calling or via a button), the main bot sends the input text to `tool_bot`.
- The result (e.g., task created or error) is sent back and included in the main botâ€™s response.

### Notes

- The agent bot must be configured in `config.yml` with a unique `agent_name`.
- The tool interface expects an `input` argument (the text to send to the agent).
- You can chain multiple agents and tools for advanced workflows.

## Trigger agents by name

You can run any configured agent outside Telegram.

### CLI

```
npm run agent <agent_name> "your text"
```

### HTTP endpoint

POST `/agent/:agentName` with JSON `{ "text": "hi", "webhook": "<url>" }`.
Use header `Authorization: Bearer <auth_token>`.

### MQTT

Publish text to `<base><agent_name>`.
Progress messages go to `<base><agent_name>_progress` and the final answer to `<base><agent_name>_answer`.

## ollama models

Add to config.yml model, use ollama url and model name, then define `model` in the chat settings:

```
models:
  - name: qwen3:4b
    model: qwen3:4b
    url: http://192.168.1.1:11434
chats:
  - id: 123
    name: Chat with qwen
    model: qwen3:4b
```

`/info` should return actual using model.

## MCP Integration

MCP (Model Context Protocol) provides external tools and services to the bot. MCP servers are defined in the `config.mcpServers` file, which lists available MCP endpoints used by all chats.

### config.mcpServers Format

- The format of `config.mcpServers` matches the structure used in Claude Desktop.
- It is a list of MCP server configurations, each specifying the server address and connection details.
- Example:
  ```yaml
  {
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

### Server Sharing

- All MCP servers listed in `config.mcpServers` are shared between all chats.
- There is currently no per-chat isolation of MCP servers; every chat can access all configured MCP tools.

### Chat Configuration (`tools`)

- Each chat's configuration should specify a `tools` list.
- The `tools` list should include the names of tools (from MCP) that are available to that chat.
- Example chat config snippet:
  ```yaml
  - name: Memory MCP agent
    id: -123123
    tools:
      - create_entities
      - create_relations
      - add_observations
      - delete_entities
      - delete_observations
      - delete_relations
      - read_graph
      - search_nodes
      - open_nodes
  ```
- The available tool names are fetched from the MCP servers listed in `config.mcpServers`.

Refer to the MCP and Claude Desktop documentation for further details on server configuration and tool discovery.

## Langfuse Setup

This bot supports [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) for tracing, analytics, and observability of chat and tool usage.

Add your Langfuse credentials to your config (e.g., `config.yml`):

```yaml
langfuse:
  secretKey: <your_secret_key>
  publicKey: <your_public_key>
  baseUrl: https://cloud.langfuse.com
```

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This will execute all unit and integration tests in the `tests` directory using the `jest` framework.
